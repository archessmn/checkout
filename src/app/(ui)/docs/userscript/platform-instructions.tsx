          long as you remember what you chose.

          Once you have downloaded the file &quot;userscript.js&quot;, open up
          the &quot;Files&quot; app and find the downloaded file. It should be
          available from the recents tab at the bottom of the screen, or from
          the &quot;Downloads&quot; folder often found in iCloud Drive. If
          neither of these help, simply search for &quot;userscript.js&quot;.
          Once you have located the file, long press to bring up the menu and
          select &quot;Move&quot;. Navigate to the directory you set for the
          Userscripts app earlier, then confirm with either &quot;Copy&quot; or
          &quot;Move&quot; in the top right corner.

          The last step is to enable the extension for safari. Navigate to
          settings and search for &quot;Extensions&quot;. Locate
          &quot;Userscripts&quot; and allow the extension. Switch back to safari
          and go to the checkin page. Click the puzzle icon in the search bar,
          locate &quot;Userscripts&quot; in the extensions menu, and enable it.

          You can verify the script is working correctly by navigating to the
          checkin page where the title should change to &quot;Check-Out&quot;
